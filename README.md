# Calculator  
Example calculator  
### Description  
The project is an example calculator we completed in class.  
It was an exercise in modules, importing and exporting, event listeners, basic math functions, etc.  
We created a basic complex of modules and used importing and exporting functions to get the modules to interact to create functionality.  
Note: the app is not completely functional, but this was due to a flaw in how the exercise was constructed as opposed to the class's execution of the assignment.
